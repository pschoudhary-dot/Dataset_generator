    "transcript": "User: Hello?\nAgent: \"Hi Uriel, this is Sophie from Wellness Wag. I saw that you are almost finished with your ESA letter application, but didnâ€™t complete the final step of processing your payment. I just wanted to check in and see if you have any questions, or if there is anything I can do to assist you?\"\nUser: No. Not really. Not at the moment. I'm just I was looking for my other esa letter that I had for my dog and making sure that it wasn't still active at all. Was trying to do for it, paint any movements on this.\nAgent: I understand, Uriel. Just to clarify, ESA letters are valid for one year from the date they are issued and must be renewed annually to remain active. If your previous letter has expired, you would need a new one to ensure it remains valid.\n\nDoes that answer your question? Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!\n"
