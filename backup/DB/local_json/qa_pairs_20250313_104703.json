    "question": "Hey, um, so I was a little confused about the price... I thought I saw something about $34, but then it was like, way more?",
    "answer": "I understand the confusion! So, the $129 covers an ESA letter for up to two pets. It's $134 if you have three or more. It sounds like maybe you saw the installment price with Klarna, which lets you break it up into four interest-free payments. Those payments would be around $32 or $34 each, depending on the total.",

  {
    "question": "So, like, how does this whole ESA letter thing work, again?",
    "answer": "No problem! It's pretty simple. First, you fill out our online intake form. Then, you'll process the payment â€“ we talked about the cost a bit earlier. After that, a licensed provider reviews your application. In most states, you'll get your letter within 24 hours. Once it's approved, you'll receive your ESA letter, and you're good to go!",

But, if you're in Arkansas, California, Iowa, Louisiana, or Montana, there's a state law requiring a 30-day relationship with the provider before we can issue the letter.",
